Network monitoring is a set of management actions to watch/continuously overview and optionally save the network traffic for further investigation. This action aims to detect and reduce network problems, improve performance, and in some cases, increase overall productivity. It is a main part of the daily IT/SOC operations and differs from Network Security Monitoring (NSM) in its purpose.

## Network Monitoring

Network monitoring is highly focused on IT assets like uptime (availability), device health and connection quality (performance), and network traffic balance and management (configuration). Monitoring and visualising the network traffic, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis are also part of the Network Monitoring process. This model is helpful for network administrators and usually doesn't cover identifying non-asset in-depth vulnerabilities and significant security concerns like internal threats and zero-day vulnerabilities. Usually, Network Monitoring is not within the SOC scope. It is linked to the enterprise IT/Network management team.

## Network Security Monitoring

Network Security Monitoring is focused on network anomalies like rogue hosts, encrypted traffic, suspicious service and port usage, and malicious/suspicious traffic patterns in an intrusion/anomaly detection and response approach. Monitoring and visualising the network traffic and investigating suspicious events is a core part of Network Security Monitoring. This model is helpful for security analysts/incident responders, security engineers and threat hunters and covers identifying threats, vulnerabilities and security issues with a set of rules, signatures and patterns. Network Security Monitoring is part of the SOC, and the actions are separated between tier 1-2-3 analyst levels.

## What is ZEEK?

Zeek (formerly Bro) is an open-source and commercial passive Network Monitoring tool (traffic analysis framework) developed by Lawrence Berkeley Labs. Today, Zeek is supported by several developers, and Corelight provides an Enterprise-ready fork of Zeek. Therefore this tool is called both open source and commercial. The differences between the open-source version and the commercial version are detailed here.



Zeek differs from known monitoring and IDS/IPS tools by providing a wide range of detailed logs ready to investigate both for forensics and data analysis actions. Currently, Zeek provides 50+ logs in 7 categories.




## Zeek Architecture

Zeek has two primary layers; "Event Engine" and "Policy Script Interpreter". The Event Engine layer is where the packets are processed; it is called the event core and is responsible for describing the event without focusing on event details. It is where the packages are divided into parts such as source and destination addresses, protocol identification, session analysis and file extraction. The Policy Script Interpreter layer is where the semantic analysis is conducted. It is responsible for describing the event correlations by using Zeek scripts.

##  Working with Zeek

There are two operation options for Zeek. The first one is running it as a service, and the second option is running the Zeek against a pcap. Before starting working with Zeek, let's check the version of the Zeek instance with the following command: `zeek -v`

Now we are sure that we have Zeek installed. Let's start the Zeek as a service! To do this, we need to use the "ZeekControl" module, as shown below. The "ZeekControl" module requires superuser permissions to use. You can elevate the session privileges and switch to the superuser account to examine the generated log files with the following command: `sudo su`

```powershell
root@ubuntu$ zeekctl
Welcome to ZeekControl 2.X.0
[ZeekControl] > status
Name         Type       Host          Status    Pid    Started
zeek         standalone localhost     stopped
[ZeekControl] > start
starting zeek ...
[ZeekControl] > status
Name         Type       Host          Status    Pid    Started
zeek         standalone localhost     running   2541   13 Mar 18:25:08
[ZeekControl] > stop
stopping zeek ...
[ZeekControl] > status
Name         Type       Host          Status    Pid    Started
zeek         standalone localhost     stopped
```

You can also use the "ZeekControl" mode with the following commands as well;

`zeekctl status`
`zeekctl start`
`zeekctl stop`

The only way to listen to the live network traffic is using Zeek as a service. Apart from using the Zeek as a network monitoring tool, we can also use it as a packet investigator. To do so, we need to process the pcap files with Zeek, as shown below. Once you process a pcap file, Zeek automatically creates log files according to the traffic.



In pcap processing mode, logs are saved in the working directory. You can view the generated logs using the `ls -l` command.  

```powershell
root@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r sample.pcap 

root@ubuntu$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  11366 Mar 13 20:45 conn.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu    763 Mar 13 20:45 dhcp.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu   2918 Mar 13 20:45 dns.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu    254 Mar 13 20:45 packet_filter.log
```
